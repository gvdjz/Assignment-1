                            The popularity poll was led by Canadian-Swiss Bernard Weber and organized by the New7Wonders Foundation based in Zurich, Switzerland,
                             with winners announced on 7 July 2007 in Lisbon. The New7Wonders Foundation claimed that more than 100 million votes were cast through the Internet or by telephone.
                             Voting via the Internet was limited to one vote for seven monuments per person/identity, but multiple voting was possible through telephone.
                             Hence the poll was considered unscientific.According to John Zogby, founder and current President/CEO of the Utica, New York-based polling organization Zogby International,
                             New7Wonders Foundation drove "the largest poll on record".</p>
